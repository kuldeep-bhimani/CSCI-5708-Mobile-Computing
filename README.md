# Revitalize - One-stop habit Manager

Habit Manager is everything you need to get motivated, stay on track, and accomplish your goals. It has always been challenging to keep a Check on the habit and build them more robust. It could be as small as drinking water every two hours or stopping eating junk food; we have covered it all. We have a flexible calendar where you can easily maintain the logs and get notified when you achieve a streak. We also can get a reminder, so even if you forget, our app doesn’t. Holistically, we aimed to create a tool to track habits with two objectives, keeping it beautiful and simple.


## Installation

Step 1: Create a Project in Android Studio

In order to develop an Android app, you need to create a project in the Android Studio IDE. First, be sure to install the latest version of Android Studio IDE from their Official Website. After installation, launch the IDE. It will open the Welcome to Android Studio window. Here, you can create a New Project.

On the next page, choose Empty Activity and click on Next. This will take you to the Configuration Window

Step 2: Add Build Dependencies into Your Project’s Library

In the main menu of the project, navigate to Gradle Scripts > build.gradle. In this location, you can find 2 gradle files – one for the project and another for the app. We will be dealing with the app gradle because this gradle is the key zone that allows us to add our chat features to our app

Step 3: Once the Gradle build is successful, click on green run button.

Step 4 : Register a user and then you can use the same credentials for the login. Now you can explore all functionalities of the applciation.
